Hi Mike.  

This is you talking to yourself on this markdown file.  One that will, when I hit `:w`, will compile to its html and add the styles and other things like that.  One of the first things to do is to analyze this build system I inherit from Phil Hawksworth's starter [template](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone).  By going the SSG route, I have sacrificed, perhaps, lessons of a more marketable sort, but there is still certainly some things to learn.
## Things to figure out about this website (technical, inherited template):
* *why* does saving the file update my site?
* Where does CSS actually happen here, how is it compiling?  Learning about postCSS and eleventy.
* How might this template provide avenues to greater, more parallel structures?
## Things to figure out about this website
* what do I want out of it?
* will I ever share it?
* Who is my voice.  
* how to deal with squirrel et al

But more,
