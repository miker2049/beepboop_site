Some reflections on music released in 2019.

### _1000 Gecs_ - 100 Gecs

Enough has been said, I assume, on the changing nature of how music is delivered and consumed in the later part of this decade.  There have been plenty, and I'm sure there will be more, well-meaning outcries that the monolithic algorithms of the streaming market have begun to work not only in the requests and responses of the client and server, but indeed is implicating itself more and more in the content itself that it was charged with organizing and reapeating at intervals precisely dialed in by user feedback.  That is, the atomization and abstraction of taste to a unknowable machine-language, in the service of nothing less than the inhuman bourgeosie infromation class(TODO Wark citation), _must_ in turn mean that artists too suffer something.  Such kinds of concerns are not new: pop music has historically been considered something other than music made by artists, and the "algorithm" in today's discourse is in some ways just a stand-in for the anonymous banality of the "mainstream".  But the concern of the algorithm is also something different; it posits something like the following: "The more we dont understand the machinations of capital responsible for distributing itself as culture or media, the more the artist must alienate themselves from their own self-expression in order to be heard."  Namely, that it is not enough anymore to for would-be artists to compromise themselves in ways they recognize, or even are aware of.  Music is not played for people anymore, and some canon set of aesthetic tropes has been traded-in for an ever sustained feedback.  We make things for the algorithm now, as it is told.

Despite the reality of our techno-fascism, despite the atomizing ocean of Spotify et al, despite even all the other ways we learn to understand and articulate the fucking torturous hell of this space we all identify as living, people still make music.  

In 100 Gecs we hear the above world but we dont hear loss.  We hear a kaleidescope of algorithms compressing and decompressing genre data and user affectivity keywords and quantized premium Ableton presets, but we dont hear a hint of bitterness for "artists" who want to be more than they are presently allowed to be in all this.  In fact, we hear everything in this album, but more importantly we hear the _joy_ of everything.  Not the joy of every single thing, but properly the joy of the singular everything, throbbing underneath us and burning all around us.

In a word, _1000 Gecs_ is good because it instructs us of a kind of self-aware joy in 2019 that is not reduced to either facile escapism or "as if" utopianism.  There are troubles: not having any money, dishes piling up, there are arguments in the studio.  We hear, elsewhere, a properly "zoomer" "vulnerability", which of course is not vulnerability at all, but simply an empathy that could only exist as a side effect of an age where people find themselves on Tumblr, or in the half-sarcastic play of culture tourism only possible when cultures are consumed and used at the rate of production (this is how movies work).  

What is it really, that tacit secret piece that earns 100 Gecs a place along side Death Grips and Kero Kero Bonito in specialized circles of internetdom.  Themselves bands chosen by a certain evolution of hipster who has traded horizontal completionism and neckbeard gatekeeping for a kind of wholesome pure child wonder at a few well chosen specimen.  Such kinds of fandom, in their adjacency to 4chan stuff TODO, should but enough to make one wary.  The touchpoints of angry absurdity that they seem to attribute to 100 Gecs comes dangersouly close to an edgelord nihilism from which it seems many do not recover.

But, I would argue, there is confidence in these songs, there is strength.  But it becomes obvious as we go along that the strength is something outside them and outside us.  They perform strength for us and for them, or more generally, there can only be strength if we all get together and pretend first that we have strength.  It is not properly there, this strength, but by an absurd collection of beliefs and gestures, there is a point where strength has in fact been there all along.  The absurdity, the beaming, crunchy silliness of this album does more than just protect the artist from a self-seriousness that is threatened in its passing moments of pathos; or place their work in something empty and purely affective.  


Any why not triumphant? 

juxtaposition of having bad luck on at the race track (to skittering ska standout).  All these are not the "irony sickness" as the transitional stage before getting to dirtbag nihilism, or simply so many different ways of saying "Ok, boomer".

The two punctuating semi-instrumental tracks on the album give space to curl into the 

There is politics, there is activism, there are enemies.  But there is also a glee we need more and more.  One that doesnt operate in the exlcusion of reality, in an unreal subjunctive clause of "as if".  Rather, we need a, perhaps willfully irresponsible, glee for the shit, because it can be fun, and to have fun, like really have fun, is, and I say this with utter seriousness, radical.  In fact, I posit such glee as an anodyne to an ideology that becomes more material everyday, to a situation where things are not divided between people and their masters, between labor and capital.  To a situation in fact where things that really matter become TODO.  

We need not be afraid of losing ourselves by taking in too much, by consuming too much that is made for us to consume.  We can be protected not by a disavowal of these things, or by a contrary focus on the old kinds of spaces, there is no hope of that anyway (well maybe the latter).  Because the truth is that it is even out the hands of those who profit from it, from those who exploit it.  They will destroy the world, but the will not write its songs or scream at it in quite the same ways.  We live and die in a petri dish of stimulation, one that is only contained by capital.  

If, after everything is in place, some might be left to look around at whats left, I dream of them finding the kind of spirit that I feel in _1000 Gecs_.  


### _Proto_ - Holly Herndon

Specialized circles of leftist philosophy once dabbled in a kind "accelerationism" that posited that the world long recognized by certain liberal concepts of humanism is already lost, that humanity would be subordinated to technology in ways quite literally borrowed from  

### _Norman Fucking Rockwell_ - Lana Del Ray

An album is like a book. A book is like a place.  People are also like places sometimes, except when they are more like albums.  If a person is a place, then they are not an album, but they do make albums.  This is what I think of Lana Del Ray.  

Let me explain.  

In 2010,
